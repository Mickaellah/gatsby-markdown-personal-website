![Image slider](./photograph.png)

This website is my first ever published work in the web. It is built with HTML, SASS, CSS, and a bit of Vanilla Javascript for the image slider. It is a responsive landing page where you can see a few images of scenery.

&nbsp;
**Features:**\
1- Select a thumbnail to display the bigger version of the picture.\
2- Image slider created with a Vanilla Javascript function.
