![Learn gasy](./learn-gasy-dark-mode.png)

This is a CRUD  app, and it is created from scratch. The data  used in this project is from a local json file. It took us about a couple of months to complete this project and the purpose of it was to help English speakers to learn Malagasy and Malagasy speakers to learn English."
